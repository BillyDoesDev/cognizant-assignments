# Cognizant dotnet-fse assignments for `6364473`

All the `.cs` files are run with `mono` and `mcs` for the sake of simplicity. Here's an example:

```sh
mcs Program.cs -out:bin/binaries/Program.exe && mono bin/binaries/Program.exe
```
This one liner compiles a single `.cs` file, outputs it into `bin/binaries` and then runs it with `mono`

A summary of all the programs listed along with their outputs can be found at `outputs.md`.
